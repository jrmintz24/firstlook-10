      story: "Sarah used to spend every Saturday being shuttled around by agents who barely knew her name. She'd get pressured into making quick decisions on homes she wasn't sure about, all while feeling like she was wasting everyone's time when she said 'maybe.' With FirstLook, Sarah can explore neighborhoods at her own pace, ask real questions without sales pressure, and only involve an agent when she's ready to make an offer. She found her dream condo after touring 8 properties over 3 months‚Äîon her timeline.",

      location: "Capitol Hill",
      title: "Transparency Changed Everything",
      story: "Marcus was frustrated by hidden costs and unclear commission structures that seemed to change depending on which agent he talked to. Traditional buyers' agents would quote different rebate amounts, and he never knew what he was actually paying for. FirstLook's transparent pricing meant he knew exactly what he'd pay upfront‚Äî$39/month for tours, and a clear rebate structure if he decided to buy. When he purchased his townhouse, he saved over $12,000 in commission rebates that he put toward renovations.",

      title: "Building Market Knowledge Without Commitment",
      story: "As a first-time buyer, Priya felt overwhelmed by the pressure to 'get serious' with an agent before she even knew what she wanted. She wasn't ready to commit to exclusive representation, but she needed to understand the market. FirstLook let her tour different types of properties, ask questions about neighborhoods, and build real expertise over 6 months. When she finally found 'the one,' she had the confidence to negotiate effectively and knew she was making the right choice.",
