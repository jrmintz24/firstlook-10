Excited for weekend tours, she called the first listing agent Saturday morning. \"Sorry, you'll need to work with a buyer's agent first. Here's my colleague's number.\" By noon, she'd signed a buyer agreement she didn't fully understand just to see one house. The agent rushed her through 3 showings in 2 hours, pushing for quick decisions on each. \"This market moves fast,\" he kept saying. Sarah felt pressured and overwhelmed.",

          story: "Sarah spotted those same 4 homes Friday night. By Saturday morning, she'd booked all 4 tours through FirstLookâ€”the earliest starting at 10 AM. Each tour was led by a licensed DC pro who answered her questions without any sales pressure. Sarah took photos, made notes, and even FaceTimed her mom from the second house. After all 4 tours, she had time to think. Two weeks later, she made an informed offer on her favoriteâ€”and got a $8,400 commission rebate at closing.",

          story: "Marcus had been working with an agent for 3 months. When he finally found 'the one'â€”a Capitol Hill rowhouseâ€”his agent mentioned a 'small rebate' of $1,500. Marcus was thrilled until he did the math later. On a $600,000 purchase, the buyer agent commission was $18,000. His 'generous' agent had kept $16,500 of what was technically Marcus's money. He felt deceived and wondered what other buyers were missing out on.",

FirstLook kept their 10% service fee ($1,500) and gave Marcus the remaining $13,500 at closing. Clear, transparent, and fair. Marcus used that money for new hardwood floors and still had enough left over for a vacation. 'Finally, someone who works for the buyer,' he said.",
