  const gettingStartedFAQs = [
    {
      question: "‚ùì What is FirstLook?",
      answer: "FirstLook is a home touring platform built for modern buyers. We let you schedule showings on your terms‚Äîwith no contracts, no pressure, and no gatekeeping. Want to bring in an agent later? Cool. Want to go solo until you're ready to make an offer? Also fine. You're in control.",
      icon: Home
    },
    {
      question: "üí° Why was FirstLook created?",
      answer: "After a 2024 legal settlement, buyers are now responsible for signing their own buyer agency agreements and paying their agents directly. This left a lot of buyers confused‚Äîand unrepresented. FirstLook bridges that gap by: Letting you tour homes freely, Offering optional help when you're ready, Giving you access to huge commission rebates. We're here to make buying a home simpler, fairer, and a whole lot less pushy.",
      icon: Shield
    },
    {
      question: "üîè Will I be asked to sign anything?",
      answer: "Before your first tour, you'll sign a simple, non-exclusive, non-paid tour agreement that satisfies state requirements. It's not a commitment‚Äîit's just a permission slip so your showing agent can legally walk you through the property.",
      icon: Shield
    }
  ];

  const touringProcessFAQs = [
    {
      question: "üè† Can I really see a home without hiring an agent?",
      answer: "Yes! With FirstLook, you can book one free tour a month (on the Basic plan), and up to five a month on Premium. No contracts, no pressure. You only connect with an agent if you choose to.",
      icon: Home
    },
    {
      question: "üìÖ How do I book a tour?",
      answer: "Easy: Find a home you want to see, Enter the address on FirstLook, Pick a time that works for you, A licensed pro will meet you there",
      icon: Calendar
    },
    {
      question: "üîê Is FirstLook safe and private?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Your contact info is never shared with agents unless you explicitly choose to connect with one. All of our showing partners are licensed professionals who pass a screening and onboarding process. You'll always know who you're meeting and when. We also provide: Agent profiles and reviews, Tour confirmations with full details, A secure messaging system for any follow-up questions. Your privacy and safety are our top priorities.",
      icon: Shield
    },
    {
      question: "üìÑ What happens after I tour a home?",
      answer: "Nothing‚Äîunless you want more help. You can: Keep browsing and booking tours, Upgrade your plan to unlock offer-writing tools, Ask FirstLook to help write and negotiate an offer",
      icon: Users
    }
  ];

  const pricingCommissionFAQs = [
    {
      question: "üßæ How does the commission rebate work?",
      answer: "If the seller offers a buyer agent commission (which many still do), and you buy through FirstLook: We collect the commission at closing, We keep just 10% as a service fee, You get 90% back as a rebate. Example: Seller offers 2.5% on a $500,000 home = $12,500, FirstLook keeps $1,250, You get $11,250 back at closing üí∏",
      icon: DollarSign
    },
    {
      question: "üö´ Are there any hidden fees?",
      answer: "Nope. Our pricing is simple, transparent, and month-to-month. Cancel anytime. Extra tours and offer-writing help are clearly priced and optional.",
      icon: AlertCircle
    },
    {
      question: "üí∞ How much does FirstLook cost?",
      answer: "We offer flexible pricing: Basic plan includes 1 free tour per month, Premium plan includes up to 5 tours per month plus offer-writing tools, Pay-per-tour options are also available. All plans are month-to-month with no long-term commitments.",
      icon: CreditCard
    }
  ];

  const flexibilityChoiceFAQs = [
    {
      question: "üë©‚Äçüíº Do I have to use FirstLook for the whole transaction?",
      answer: "Nope. After touring, you can: Use FirstLook to help you write and manage your offer (Premium plan), Choose one of our agents to represent you and pay a discounted referral fee, Or go off-platform and work directly with your favorite agent‚Äîwe'll just collect a referral fee based on how many homes they showed you",
      icon: Handshake
    },
    {
      question: "üìç Why can't I just use Zillow?",
      answer: "You can‚Äîbut here's the catch: Zillow sends your info to 3+ agents instantly, You get hit with sales calls, You're pushed to sign contracts before you're ready. FirstLook puts the buyer first. No spam. No pressure. Just tours when and how you want them.",
      icon: Shield
    },
    {
      question: "üèòÔ∏è Can I work with my own agent if I change my mind?",
      answer: "Absolutely! FirstLook is designed to give you maximum flexibility. You can start touring homes with us and later decide to work with your own agent for offers and negotiations. We're not here to lock you in‚Äîwe're here to give you options.",

      icon: MapPin
